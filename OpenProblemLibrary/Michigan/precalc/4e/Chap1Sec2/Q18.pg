BEGIN_TEXT

Suppose that you have zero dollars now and that the average rate of change in your net worth is $DOLLAR$aroc per year.  How much money will you have in $years years?

$PAR
answer = \{ ans_rule(35) \} dollars

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR



You start with no money.  Each year, on average, your net worth
increases by $DOLLAR$aroc, so in $years years, you will have \($years \times $aroc = $ans \) dollars.
