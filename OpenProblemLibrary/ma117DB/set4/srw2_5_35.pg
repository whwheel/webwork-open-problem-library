BEGIN_TEXT
The graph of the function 
\( y = $b + (x+$a)^2 \)
can be obtained from the graph of
\( y = x^2 \)
by one of the following actions:

(a) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the right $a units;

(b) shifting the graph of \(f(x)\) to the left $a units;

(c) vertically stretching the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

(d) vertically shrinking the graph of \(f(x)\) by a factor $a;

Your answer is (input a, b, c, or d) \{ans_rule(15) \}

BEGIN_TEXT
Then followed by one of the following actions:

(e) shifting the resulting graph upward $b units;

(f) shifting the resulting graph downward $b units;

(g) horizontally stretching the resulting graph by a factor $b;

(h) horizontally shrinking the resulting graph  by a factor $b;

Your answer is (input e, f, g,  or h) \{ans_rule(15) \}
